        <h2>How Our Project Meets the Requirements</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                This is the URL to our GitHub repository, shared with each other and the professor:
                <a href="https://github.com/343-F24-Shrestha/343f24final-financeapp" target="_blank">GitHub Repository</a>
            </li>
            <li>
                This is the URL to our deployed application where anyone can try our app:
                <a href="https://343-f24-shrestha.github.io/343f24final-financeapp/" target="_blank">Deployed Application</a>
            </li>
            <li>
                Our site uses media queries to support distinct layouts for large and small screens.
                You can see this in our CSS files, where media queries control images and switch between rows and columns.
                <!-- Add media query examples in your CSS files and use comments to indicate where they are -->
            </li>
            <li>
                We have at least 6 separate pages, each with a meaningful purpose:
                <ul>
                    <li><a href="index.html">Index Page (Home) click the buttons to go to annual income Page</a></li>
                    <li><a href="annual_income.html">Annual Income Page, click the buttons to go to money left page</a></li>
                    <li><a href="money_left.html">Money left Page, click the buttons to go to low risk page</a></li>
                    <li><a href="low_risk.html">Low Risk Investing page, Click the Click here for high risk page</a></li>
                    <li><a href="high_risk.html">High-Risk Investment, click at the bottom in the footer the click here to view reconsider investing page </a></li>
                    <li><a href="reconsider_investing.html">Reconsider Investing, this is the last page, you can click the button in the footer to go to the home page</a></li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                Each page includes a header to introduce the page content. Headers are styled in each CSS file with background colors and text styles.
            </li>
            <li>
                Our site includes navigation links that allow users to move between pages in a meaningful flow. For example, on each page, there are links back to the homepage and to related pages.
            </li>
            <li>
                We include images with appropriate alt attributes for accessibility and to aid users with images disabled or using screen readers, just look <a href="index.html">here</a>.
            </li>
            <li>
                We validated each page and stylesheet using the Nu Validator and the WAVE Web Accessibility Evaluator. No warnings or errors were reported.
            </li>
            <li>
                Our site uses at least two different font faces. We use a sans-serif font for headings and a serif font for paragraph text to create visual distinction.
            </li>
            <li>
                We included a form on our main page (index.html). This form prompts the user to select their age group. The form includes basic content verification for demonstration purposes.
            </li>
            <li>
                We included external links on multiple pages. For example, there will be links on the high risk and low risk pages and other pages within our report demonstrate this requirement.
            </li>
            <li>
                For the next milestone's interactivity, we are planning to use the following APIs:
                <ul>
                    <li><a href="https://developers.giphy.com/docs/api#quick-start-guide" target="_blank">Giphy API</a> for fetching GIFs based on investment topics.</li>
                    <li><a href="https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/reference" target="_blank">Spotify Web API</a> to suggest investment-related podcasts or motivational content.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ol>
