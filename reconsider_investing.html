        <ol>
            <li>Focus on your current career; consider asking for a pay raise or taking on more work.</li>
            <li>Start a side business or find additional sources of income.</li>
            <li>Create a budget plan: Follow the 50/30/20 ruleâ€”50% of income for needs, 30% for wants, and 20% for savings or debt payments.</li>
